        Citing <a href="https://libraries.indiana.edu/catherine-minter">Catherine Minter</a> from her 2013 article "Academic Library Reform and the Ideal
of the Librarian in England, France,and <br> Germany in the Long Nineteenth Century":
        <blockquote style="max-width: 80%">
          At the end of the eighteenth century, academic and research libraries throughout
Western Europe were often poorly stocked because they had no steady fund for book
purchases. In Great Britain, the Bodleian was deeply deficient in terms of its holdings,
even after almost two centuries of existence. It was not until 1780 that an annual fee
of four shillings was imposed on all persons entitled to read in the Library and on all
who had exceeded four years from matriculation, and the Library was assigned a
share of matriculation fees, in an effort to remedy its acknowledged shortcomings.
