	abstract = {Since Windschitl first outlined a research agenda for the World Wide Web and classroom research, significant shifts have occurred in the nature of the Web and the conceptualization of classrooms. Such shifts have affected constructs of learning and instruction, and paths for future research. This article discusses the characteristics of Web 2.0 that differentiate it from the Web of the 1990s, describes the contextual conditions in which students use the Web today, and examines how Web 2.0’s unique capabilities and youth’s proclivities in using it influence learning and teaching. Two important themes, learner participation and creativity and online identity formation, emerged from this analysis and support a new wave of research questions. A stronger research focus on students’ everyday use of Web 2.0 technologies and their learning with Web 2.0 both in and outside of classrooms is needed. Finally, insights on how educational scholarship might be transformed with Web 2.0 in light of these themes are discussed.},

Colomb and Joseph M. Williams present an updated third edition of their classic handbook, whose first and second editions were written in collaboration with the late Wayne C. Booth. The Craft of Research explains how to build an argument that motivates readers to accept a claim; how to anticipate the reservations of readers and to respond to them appropriately; and how to create introductions and conclusions that answer that most demanding question, “So what?” The third edition includes an expanded discussion of the essential early stages of a research task: planning and drafting a paper. The authors have revised and fully updated their section on electronic research, emphasizing the need to distinguish between trustworthy sources (such as those found in libraries) and less reliable sources found with a quick Web search. A chapter on warrants has also been thoroughly reviewed to make this difficult subject easier for researchers Throughout, the authors have preserved the amiable tone, the reliable voice, and the sense of directness that have made this book indispensable for anyone undertaking a research project.},

The purpose of this paper is to ask, how can librarians and faculty become genuine partners in student learning and move towards the common goal of getting students to think critically? The authors discuss the need for librarians to initiate more collaborative conversations with professors in order to establish true partnerships with them and go on to describe how they did this using a strikingly and alarmingly frank approach. Building on this foundation, the authors discuss the need to shift from a service orientation to a partnership in student learning. Design/methodology/approach – The authors describe their work with the New Faculty Institute, a multi-day workshop that serves as an introduction to the university, to build upon their assertions regarding the need for instruction librarians to shift from a service orientation to a partnership with professors. Findings – The paper offers an action plan to develop and implement a value system that can guide collaboration with faculty. The pieces of the plan include articulating a teaching philosophy, craft and clarify personal policies, develop and practice responses and have confidence in your expertise. Originality/value – Developing partnerships with professors may sometimes require librarians to respond differently to requests from professors that are problematic. Doing so requires a move away from a service orientation, but towards collaborative efforts to support student learning.},

The most successful interviews involve the librarian finding out "the situation behind the query and the intended uses on the information."

Research objectives include: (1) to develop and test a model of the reference interview in which the Web becomes an important component; (2) to determine which model is most effective in satisfying user needs; and (3) to rate models according to perceptions and evaluations of users and librarians. Observing the traditional reference interview process reveals that an initial user query is followed by a series of questions posed by the librarian for the purpose of query clarification. Interpersonal communication facilitates this process, but predictable problems and difficulties for both user and librarian often arise. Results offer fresh perspectives on the reference interview process and lend support to the adoption of a new reference model which importantly shifts its venue from a person-to-person process to one in which information itself provides the platform for user and librarian interaction.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to clarify the ways in which students seek help in libraries, and their feelings about using library enquiry services. In this way, it should bring practical benefits to academic libraries seeking to design and introduce new forms of reference service. The paper also aims to touch on the issue of whether anonymity offered by digital reference services is likely to make more students ask for help. A major aim of this study is to find ways to encourage those students who need help, to seek it. Designlmethodology/approach - This paper uses the results taken from 12 qualitative interviews with undergraduate students to examine these students' help-seeking methods and their use of academic library reference services. Findings - The study finds that the reasons for not using enquiry services were various and complex and included a lack of awareness of services, embarrassment or shyness, anxiety caused by mechanical barriers and affective barriers. The interviews revealed that shyness is more widespread than libraries might imagine and seemingly confident students can find asking for help embarrassing in some circumstances. Originality/value - This paper focuses on students' thoughts and opinions, and it is this student-centred approach which gives particular insight into the reasons students do not seek help. This adds to the body of qualitative research examining undergraduates' help seeking methods and provides practical advice for encouraging students to ask for help.

The subject-specialist approach increases the effectiveness of collection development, classroom instruction, and faculty liaison interactions. Simultaneously, this approach creates the need for continuous learning opportunities. Conferences organized around academic disciplines provide a direct connection to subject-specific information as well as opportunities for meeting people who share common interests. With the increase in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches to teaching and research, the authors argue that attending subject-specific conferences is the best way to keep up with information needs in various fields. This article reviews the benefits of attending academic conferences and discusses five strategies for selecting an appropriate subject conference in any discipline.

Embedded librarian programs give librarians the opportunity to meet distance students in their natural habitats by participating in classroom instruction.

An analysis of Capella's 2007 library reference traffic revealed a 400\% jump in reference transactions with psychology students, coinciding with the introduction of the embedded librarian program. This study establishes a statistically significant relationship between the number of embedded librarian interactions in the classroom and the increased number of general reference transactions. While this study may provide an encouraging case for libraries considering an embedded program who want to advertise their help services, it might also provide a discouraging case study for libraries who hope to drive down general reference questions through embedded librarian initiatives.

Design/methodology/approach - A literature search was conducted to explore the current best practices for ongoing professional training. A follow up survey was conducted among reference librarians to gain insights into their attitudes toward generalist and subject specialist reference activities, and their participation in, and attitudes toward, related professional education and training. Findings - The results suggest that the reference librarians who responded have a high comfort level for answering queries in a range of subject areas, and that while some librarians may defer to a readily available subject expert this is not a reflection of their confidence in their own ability to have assisted the patron. Practical implications - Based on the insights garnered from this survey, the authors did an additional review of the literature and incorporated the additional research for their conclusions and recommendations as to how reference librarians, regardless of whether they regard themselves as generalists or specialists, can best expand their knowledge of reference sources in additional fields and answer queries outside their areas of expertise. Originality/value - Other libraries and reference librarians can use the results of the paper to develop their own training/professional development programs and activities.},

This article reports on the methodology used to collect and analyze the data and the researchers' findings. The results show that true reference questions remained steady whether or not the reference desk was staffed.

Competencies are the knowledge, skills and personal traits that enable the professional librarian to function effectively in the tasks considered essential in the profession. Communication and interpersonal skills have always been necessary for successful reference work but are seen to be even more critical in today's automated environment. Professional development activities can be characterized as formal or informal types of activities. Librarians seem to prefer informal types of professional development. Deterrents to participation in professional development activities can be characterized as either work-related or non-work-related. Data from the 1994 Adult Education and Training Survey carried out in Canada show that five percent of full-time employees ages twenty to sixty-four did not receive as much training as they were too busy. 733 professional librarians with reference duties who were working in large, urban public libraries in Ontario were surveyed. The Barriers to Participation score ranged from 19 to 86, with a mean score of 51.1 and a median of 52.0. Search strategies for both Internet and electronic resources were also a popular topic as 68 percent of librarians identified this as a topic of study. Just over half the librarians were learning about the integrated library system applications in their libraries.},

Her handbook takes the guesswork out of this delicate but necessary process, giving public and school library staff the knowledge and the confidence to effectively weed any collection, of any size. Going through the proverbial stacks shelf by shelf, VnukExplains why weeding is important for a healthy library, demonstrating that a vibrant collection leads to robust circulation, which in turn affects library budgetsWalks readers through a library s shelves by Dewey area, with recommended weeding criteria and call-outs in each area for the different considerations of large collections and smaller collectionsFeatures a chapter addressing reference, media, magazines and newspapers, e-books, and other special materialsShows how a solid collection development plan uses weeding as an ongoing process, making it less stressful and more productiveOffers guidance for determining how to delegate responsibility for weeding, plus pointers for getting experienced staff on boardGives advice for educating the community about the process, how to head off PR disasters, and what to do with weeded materialsIncludes a dozen sample collection development plans, easily adaptable to suit a library's individual needsFilled with field-tested, no nonsense strategies, this handbook will enable libraries to bloom by maintaining a collection that users actually use.},

Analysis of the 606 response sets reveals trends toward reduced use of librarians and increased use of student staff at in-person service points, widespread increases in appointment-based and self-service reference, intensive efforts to reduce demand for reference by improving library instruction, and general improvements in reference service quality. Factors strongly associated with decreases or increases in quality are discussed in detail and implications for reference managers are provided.},

	abstract = {In Western Europe in the late eighteenth century, complaints were rife about the disorganization of libraries and the character of their librarians. Not only from the perspective of library users, but also from within librarians' own ranks, the sentiment became more widespread that librarians should strive to be more industrious and effective, and that libraries should aim to be better organized in order to promote use and access. The strong 'public service' orientation to nineteenth-century European library theory lay at the heart of the major practical or 'technical' innovations - notably in the fields of classification and cataloguing - which transformed librarianship into a profession towards the end of the century. This article aims to explore the impact of these innovations on the role and image of the librarian in the nineteenth century, with particular reference to academic libraries and librarians in England, France, and Germany. It is suggested that as a characteristic set of 'librarianly' virtues - prime among these being love of order, conscientiousness, selflessness, and the willingness to serve - rose to pre-eminence against the background of technical innovations in the field (and also, incidentally, as a reaction against the 'scholar librarians' of an earlier era), the seeds were sown of a crisis in the librarian's professional image and self-image with implications which may even reach into the present.},
